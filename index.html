                    Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
                    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
                    is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
                    It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                </p>

                    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                    It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented 
                    programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature,
                    make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

                Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. 
                It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. 
                The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line.
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                   Print ("Hello world")
                    </pre>

                    Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". 
                    You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. 
                    Every variable in Python is an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals).
                    To define an integer, use the following syntax:
                <code>
                    
                     number= 25
                     print (number)
                    
                </code>
                    To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:
                <code>
                    
                     myfloat = 7.0
                    print(myfloat)
                    
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
                    The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes 
                    (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)
                <code>
                    
                     mystring = 'hello'
                     print(mystring)
                     mystring = "hello"
                     print(mystring)
                    
                </code>
                </p>

                It is similar to that of other languages. 
                The if statement contains a logical expression using which data is compared and a decision 
                is made based on the result of the comparison.
          
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                    if expression:
                        statement(s)
                    </pre>
                </code>
                If the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE, then the block of statement(s)
                inside the if statement is executed. 
                If boolean expression evaluates to FALSE, then the first set of code after the end of the 
                if statement(s) is executed.
                <p>
                An else statement can be combined with an if statement.
                An else statement contains the block of code that executes 
                if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most
                     only one else statement following if.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                    if expression:
                        statement(s)
                    else:
                       statement(s)
                    </pre>
                </code>
                The elif statement allows you to check multiple
                 expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
                 <p>
                    Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional.
                    However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement,
                    there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.
                 </p>
          
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                    if expression1:
                       statement(s)
                    elif expression2:
                        statement(s)
                    elif expression3:
                       statement(s)
                    else:
                      statement(s)
                    </pre>
                </code>
    
                There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition 
                after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.
                In a nested if construct, you can have an if...elif...else construct inside another if...elif...else construct.
          
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                if expression1:
                        statement(s)
                    elif expression2:
                       statement(s)
                    elif expression3:
                      statement(s)
                    elif expression4:
                        statement(s)
                    else:
                        statement(s)
                 else:
                    statement(s)
                    </pre>

              <article>
                The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression 
                (condition) is true. We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate 
                beforehand.
                Python has two primitive loop commands:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>while</b> loops
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>for</b> loops
                    </li>
                </ul>
                With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                    i = 1
                    while i < 6:
                      print(i)
                      i += 1
                    </pre>
                </code>
                If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
          
                <p>
                    The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, 
                    in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                    With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
                </p>
          
                Example:
          
                <code>
                    <pre class="result notranslate">
                    i = 1
                    while i < 6:
                      print(i)
                      if i == 3:
                        break
                      i += 1
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Same as with for loops, while loops can also have an optional else block.
                    The else part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to False.
                    The while loop can be terminated with a break statement. In such cases, the else part is ignored. 
                    Hence, a while loop's else part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false.

                A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 
                (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages,
                and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
                <p>
                    With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
                </p>

                    The class statement creates a new class definition.
                    The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class followed by a colon as follows −
